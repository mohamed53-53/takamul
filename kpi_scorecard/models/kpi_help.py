<div style="width:80%;font-size:14px;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">A KPI period is a time frame for which companies set their targets to control 
performance (in a similar way as financial performance is controlled within accounting/fiscal periods).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPI scorecards in comparison to simple dashboard assume that you might not only have 
overview of actual figures, but to compare those to real targets. However, goals should be time-constrained ('Sell as 
much as possible' is not a goal, while 'Generate 100,000 Euro Revenue in the year 2021' is a good target for a sales 
person, for example). That is why KPI periods are introduced.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">The app allows to set periods of any length including intervals which cross each other 
(and even the Past periods!).
To open a new KPI period you should just set start and end dates. Those dates will be used to calculate KPI actual value.
For example, KPI formula might include a basic KPI measurement for total amount of sale orders, while date field of 
this measurement is defined as 'Order date'. Then, only sale orders which order date is within the period would be 
taken into account. Thus, KPI scorecard would show total revenue for a given period.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">It is recommended to have more or less strict logic of periods for comparability 
purposes. Usually, KPI targets are set for a whole year and quarterly/monthly intervals. It let not only have KPI 
overview, but also check historical trends. The app automatically considers various periods in order to define which 
might be compared to this one, and will show users a chart of actual values by a specific KPI. It is possible to define 
tolerance on the configuration page. For example, 2-days tolerance is needed to compare quarterly periods (since quarter
 might take from 90 to 92 days), and 3-days tolerance for months (unluckily, February may last 28 days).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">When end date is already in the Past, it is preferable to close the period to avoid 
further updates of KPI targets actual values due to further corrections (it is not a good idea to update December KPIs 
in the next August even though a sale total needs to be corrected, for example). This action is pretty much the same 
as when accountant finishes a fiscal year. To close a period use the button 'Close period' (this action might be rolled
back by re-opening the period).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPI periods let you also copy targets from existing periods (so, use them as a 
template). To that end just push the button 'Substitute targets' and select a period with proper KPI targets. 
It significantly saves time, since KPI targets usually remain similar for periods of the same length. Do not worry, 
after that action you would be still able to change actual scorecard for this period (for sure, until a period is 
closed).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Based on KPI periods you may also configure KPI formulas to rely upon period length in 
days to calculate figures per days, weeks, etc. To that end use the special Measurements 'Periods Days' or 'Days Passed'
(how many days already passed in comparison to today) when you construct a formula. For example, you might have average 
sales amount per week within the given period, and compare how much it changes from the previous one. That length is
calculated automatically, while you just put that to a proper formula place.</p>

<div style="width:80%;font-size:14px;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPIs (key performance indicators) are measurements which aim to evaluate organizational
or personal success of a definite activity. Different companies have different KPIs depending on their strategy and
business area. However, all KPIs have the common core attribute: they must be measurable within a target period.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">To that end KPIs allow to construct formulas to retrieve Odoo data sets and process
those to real figures. Formula preparation is as simple as it is to write down a mathematical expression: just drag and
drop formula parts in a right order with correct operators.</p>
<h3>KPIs, KPI periods, and KPI targets</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPIs represent the list of success figures you may use to plan your company activities.
Simultaneously, measurements are almost senseless unless you have target values for those KPIs. That is possible only
within a time-constrained period. 'Sell as much as you can' is not a goal, while 'Generate 100,000 Euro Revenue in the
year 2021' is a good aim for a sales person, for example. To that end KPI periods are introduced.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">A Combination of a KPI and a KPI period results in a KPI target. Exactly with those
targets you work on the score card interface. For each KPI you would like to manage in this period, you should define
a planned value to compare those to actual at the end of the period.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">So, a KPI itself defines how to compute actual value for period and how to estimate the
result ('the more the better' or 'the less the better'), but does not assume setting targets. The latter should be done
for each period.</p>
<h3>Formula parts</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">As variables for formula you may use:</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;"><i>Measurements (KPI measurements, KPI variables)</i> are figures calculated from actual
Odoo data for a checked period. For example, 'number of quotations of the sales team Europe'.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Among measurements you may also find 2 very specific variables: 'Period Days' and 'Days
Passed'. Those figures are calculated not from Odoo data, but from the KPI period settings under consideration. 'Period
Days' is an interval length in days. 'Days Passed' is a length between period start and today (if today is before period
end; otherwise period end). Those parameters let calculate per-time KPIs, such as, for example, 'Average sales per 
week'.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;"><i>Constants (KPI constants)</i> are fixed numbers applied globally or for a period.
Such numbers do not depend on Odoo data. So, they let define strict non-changeable figures which you can't otherwise get
from Odoo. For example, 'Total investments'.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;"><i>Other KPIs</i> are results of other KPI formula calculations. That variables allow to
construct derivative complex calculations and make up hierarchy. For example, you may have KPIs 'Sales count' and
'Opportunities count', and a derivative KPI 'Opportunity to sales success ratio'.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Variables of any types above might be added to a formula. You may drag and drop as many
variables as you like (and even use the same variable twice). Just do not forget to add operators in between to make
correct mathematical expressions. The following operators are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>"-" - subtraction;</li>
<li>"+" - addition;</li>
<li>"*" - multiplication;</li>
<li>"/" - division;</li>
<li>"(", ")" - to make proper calculation order as it is in Math;</li>
<li>"**" - exponentiation (**2 – squaring; **0.5 – square root extraction);</li>
<li>Float number.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Result appearance</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Depending of business logic of KPI formula, the final calculation result might have 
different form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple number: for example, 'Average sales count per week';</li>
<li>Percentage: for example, 'Sales to opportunities success ratio';</li>
<li>Monetary: for example, 'Total Sales per period'. <strong>Make sure the measurement field you used is in the same
currency (usually company default currency)!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">For simple numbers and percentage you may also define result suffix and prefix to make a
figure nice looking (e.g. add "%" as suffix to have "88<strong>%</strong>"). For monetary result type it is recommended
to define a currency, which symbol would be added to result.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Finally, you may decide how calculation result should be rounded. Available options are
from 0 to 4 decimal points (1 > 1.2 > 1.23 > 1.235 > 1.2346).</p>
<h3>Categories and hierarchy</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">To make navigation by KPI targets more comfortable, KPIs are combined into KPI
categories. It let not only quickly search targets inside a scorecard, but it let grant additive access rights. In such
a way, users would overview only their KPIs structured in sections.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Each KPI might also have a parent. Such hierarchy let organize KPI scorecard with
indicative padding. For example, 'Total company sales' might have children 'Sales Europe' and 'Sales America'. The
latter 2 might be further specified by sales persons.</p>
<h3>Additive access to KPIs and targets</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">By default KPIs and there linked targets are available only for users with the right
'KPI Manager'. Simultaneously, you may grant extra rights for other user groups or/and definite users. To that end it is
possible to define 'Read Rights' and 'Edit Rights' on KPI category or KPI form views (take into account that KPI
category rights and KPI own rights are combined!).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Read rights define which user and user groups would be able to observe KPI targets on
the scorecard interface. For example, you might want to share tasks' targets by persons with related project users in
order their control themselves.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Edit rights assume sharing an access to set specific targets up. For instance, you may
find it a good idea to involve sales manager to set sub targets for their sales team.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Take into account: all security settings are additive and they are not restrictive. KPI
managers would have full rights for all KPIs disregarding those settings, while other users would have rights only to
KPIs which settings (or category settings) allow them so.</p>

    "kpi.measure.item": _("""
<div style="width:80%;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">A KPI measurement is a final variable used for KPI(s) calculations. It represents
specification of basic measurement. For example, 'number of quotations of the sales team Europe' might be a precision of
a basic measurement 'total number of sales orders'.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Such approach significantly simplifies variables' preparation, since each basic
measurement might have an unlimited number of linked KPI measurements. So, the only thing you would need to do is to
apply extra filters (in the example 'Sales Team Name is Europe').</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Take into account that basic measurements of the type 'Execute Python code' can't be
any more specified, since they do not relate to any records. In such a case, there is no sense to have a few KPI
measurements.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">In a multi company environment KPI Measurements are applied globally or for each company
individually. In the former case that variable is available for any company KPI formulas, while in the latter – only for
 specific one (it let make quicker overview while constructing formulas).</p>
</div>
    """),
    "kpi.constant": _("""
<div style="width:80%;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">
A KPI constant is a variable type used for formula construction. In comparison to measurements, KPI constants are fixed
and they do not depend on actual Odoo data. This allows to introduce figures which can not be retrieved from modules
and/or which should remain the same during the whole period.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">For example, you might set the 'total size of investments' to calculate return on 
investments, or the 'number of salesmen' to get sales revenue per person.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPI constant value might be defined for each individual period. If the value does not 
exist for a calculated period, the app would try to check the parent time frame. For instance, if this constant value
does is not set up January 2021, the app would take all the intervals which include January (e.g. Quarter 1 2021 and the
year 2021 consequentially). In case the values is not defined for those periods as well, then, the global value would be 
applied.</p>
</div>
    """),
    "kpi.measure": _("""
<div style="width:80%;font-size:14px;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">A basic measurement is the core object used for retrieving actual KPI value from Odoo 
data. Although basic measurements are not used themselves for formula constructions, they are required to prepare any 
sort of formula variables (KPI measurements).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">A basic measurement represents the most general calculation, while KPI measurements 
specify those. For example, 'total number of sales orders' should be a basic measurement, while narrower 'number of 
quotations of the sales team Europe' is recommended to be a precision of that basic measurement (so, KPI measurement).
Each basic measurement might have an unlimited number of linked KPI measurements.</p>
<h3>Calculation Types</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Basic measurements assume a few types of low-level calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counting records, e.g. number of registered leads or a number of posted customer invoices. Such measurements should
have the KPI type 'Count of records'.</li>
<li>Summing up certain number field of records, e.g. sum of all orders amount total or sum of paid taxes by invoices.
Such measurements should have the KPI type 'Sum of records field'.</li>
<li>Getting of average for records' number fields, e.g. average planned hours per task or average days to assign a lead.
Such measurements should have the KPI type 'Average of records field'.</li>
<li>Executing Python code. This type requires technical knowledge, but let you compute any sort of figures based on any
Odoo data. Merely introduce your Python code and save the value into the special variable 'result'. Here you might also
use the special KPI period related variables: 'period_start' (the first date of the period), 'period_end' (the last date
of the period), 'period_company_id' - res.company object for which Odoo makes calculations at the moment (according to
KPI period).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Measurement Settings</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">The first 3 calculation types assume that you define how records should be searched and 
which records fields should be used for computations.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Model</i> is an Odoo document type you have in your database, so with which data set you work. For, examples,
'Sales Order' or 'Task'. Here you can rely not only upon standard objects, but also on Odoo reports. The latter is quite
useful if indicators are already calculated for existing dashboard (for example, total sales amount in default currency
from the 'Sales Analysis Report').</li>
<li><i>Date fields</i> are required to understand whether a specific document type relates to a considered period, so,
how to distribute objects by time intervals. For example, for tasks you might use 'create date' to analyze jobs
registered within this KPI period (e.g. 'Total number of tasks created in January 2021'). It is possible to apply a few
date fields (e.g. 'Opportunities opened and won in January 2021'). If date fields are not specified, KPI period would
not influence this basic measurement.</li>
<li><i>Filters</i> allow you to restrict records set by any stored field. For example, you may calculate count of only
won opportunities based on stage settings or only posted customer invoices based on journal entry type and state.</li>
<li><i>Measure field</i> is available and required only for calculation types 'Average' and 'Sum'. It defines which
figure you use for calculations. For example, total amount of Sales Analysis Report to get accumulated sales revenue or
work hours of tasks to get average spent time per each task.</li>
<li><i>Company field</i> would be needed for multi companies environment. According to that field, KPIs are considered
only withing a KPI period target company. Take into account that records without company stated would be used for
all companies' KPI calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">All settings might relate to your custom objects or custom fields, including ones
created through the interface or the Odoo studio.</p>
</div>
    """),
    "kpi.category": _("""
<div style="width:60%;">
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">KPI categories serve to structure KPIs and KPI targets for comfortable navigation. Each
KPI should be assigned for a single category, what allows users to find required targets quickly just by checking the
boxes on the scorecard interface.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Hierarchy of categories let users also combine targets in sections to control KPIs
related to specific areas. For example, to check targets only in sales (e.g. category 'sales') or targets of a 
specific sales team (e.g. category 'sales > sales team Europe').</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">Moreover, KPI categories let you administrate user accesses in a batch. Thus, you may
grant users and/or user groups an access for this category KPI ('Read Rights') or a right to update those
targets ('Edit rights)'. Thus, there would be no need to manage each KPI separately. Take into account that those
settings are additive and are not restrictive, meaning that KPI managers would any way have full rights for all
KPIs.</p>
